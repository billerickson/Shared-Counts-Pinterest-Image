This add-on for [Shared Counts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts) allows you to share a different image on Pinterest.

Shared Counts uses the post's featured image for sharing across all platforms. But given the unique display of images on Pinterest, it's useful to specify a separate, Pinterest-only image that's formatted for that service.

This plugin will only work if [Shared Counts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts) is active. It does not work with any other social sharing plugins.


## Installation ##
1. Download the plugin [from GitHub.](https://github.com/billerickson/Shared-Counts-Pinterest-Image/archive/master.zip) or from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts-pinterest-image/).
2. Activate plugin.
3. When editing a post, use the "Pinterest Sharing Image" metabox in the sidebar (see screenshot).
