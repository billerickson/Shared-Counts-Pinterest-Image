Use a separate image for sharing on Pinterest

== Description ==

This add-on for [Shared Counts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts) allows you to share a different image on Pinterest.

Shared Counts uses the post's featured image for sharing across all platforms. But given the unique display of images on Pinterest, it's useful to specify a separate, Pinterest-only image that's formatted for that service.

This plugin will only work if [Shared Counts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-counts) is active. It does not work with any other social sharing plugins.

**Customization**
By default the plugin only applies to posts, but you can [add support for other post types](https://github.com/billerickson/Shared-Counts-Pinterest-Image#customization).

If you find an bug or problem, please let us know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/billerickson/Shared-Counts-Pinterest-Image/issues?state=open).
